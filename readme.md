# CAN-BIND dMRI

This repository holds the BASH shell and python source code of programs used to preprocess and analyze the dMRI data for the CAN-BIND-1 study.

Version 1.0 of this code was used the produce the manuscript by Davis et al.: "White Matter Indices of Medication Response in Major Depression".

The code release associated with this publication has a DOI:
